# Lala Alerts

I only made this because I was bored. But anyway, this alert plugin is for popping up alerts of different statuses (currently 4 right now). But feel free to add more if you'd like. I took the colours for Twitter's Bootstrap alerts (http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/alerts/)

I used vanilla js for this alert plugin so it should run pretty fast. Feel free to optimize it even more.
